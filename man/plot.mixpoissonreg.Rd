}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class "mixpoissonreg" containing results from the fitted model.
If the model was fitted with envelope = 0, the Q-Q plot will be produced without envelopes.}

\item{which}{a list or vector indicating which plots should be displayed.     If a subset of the plots is required, specify a subset of the numbers 1:6,
see caption below for the different kinds. In
plot number 2, 'Normal Q-Q', if the \code{mixpoissonreg} object was fitted with envelopes, a quantile-quantile plot with simulated envelopes will be displayed.}

\item{caption}{captions to appear above the plots; character vector or list of valid graphics annotations. Can be set to "" or NA to suppress all captions.}

\item{sub.caption}{common title-above the figures if there are more than one. If NULL, as by default, a possible abbreviated version of \code{deparse(x$call)} is used.}

\item{qqline}{logical; if \code{TRUE} and the fit does \emph{not} contain simulated
envelopes, a qqline passing through the first and third quartiles of a standard normal distribution will be added to the normal Q-Q plot.}

\item{main}{character; title to be placed at each plot additionally (and above) all captions.}

\item{ask}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, the user is asked before each plot.}

\item{labels.id}{vector of labels, from which the labels for extreme points will be chosen. The default uses the observation numbers.}

\item{label.pos}{positioning of labels, for the left half and right half of the graph respectively, for plots 2 and 6.}

\item{type.cookplot}{character; what type of plot should be drawn for Cook's and Generalized Cook's distances (plots 3 and 4). The default is 'h'.}

\item{id.n}{number of points to be labelled in each plot, starting with the most extreme.}

\item{cex.id}{magnification of point labels.}

\item{cex.oma.main}{controls the size of the sub.caption only if that is above the figures when there is more than one.}

\item{cex.caption}{controls the size of caption.}

\item{include.modeltype}{logical. Indicates whether the model type ('NB' or 'PIG') should be displayed on the captions.}

\item{include.residualtype}{local. Indicates whether the name of the residual ('Pearson' or 'Score') should be displayed on the caption of plot 1 (Residuals vs. Index).}

\item{...}{graphical parameters to be passed.}

\description{
Currently there are six plots available. They contain residual analysis and global influence diagnostics. The plots are selectable by
the \code{which} argument. The plots are: Residuals vs. obs. numbers; Normal Q-Q plots, which may contain simulated envelopes, if the fitted object
has simulated envelopes; Cook's distances vs. obs. numbers; Generalized Cook's distances vs. obs. numbers; Cook's distances vs. Generalized Cook's distances;
Response variables vs. fitted means. By default, the first two plots and the last two plots are provided.
}
\details{
The \code{plot} method is implemented following the same structure as the \link[stats]{plot.lm}, so it will be easy to be used by practitioners that
are familiar with \code{glm} objects.

These plots allows one to perform residuals analsysis and influence diagnostics. There are other global influence functions, see \code{\link{influence.mixpoissonreg}}.
